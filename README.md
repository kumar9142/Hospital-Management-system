Project Title: Hospital Management System

This C program is a hospital appointment management system using a doubly linked list. It allows users to:

Add a patient for an appointment,

Cancel an appointment by patient ID,

Mark a patient as having come for a checkup (removes them from the front),

View all current appointments.

Each patientâ€™s details (ID, name, age, gender, address, phone number) are stored in nodes, and the list keeps them in the order of appointment.
